# 3D Interactive Map of Hanover College Campus
## Project and Features
This would be an app/part of the Hanover College website that takes your current location on Hanover College Campus and marks it on a 3D map of the campus with the blue dot that you see frequently used on most maps. 
### Features
1. The buildings and other key locations can be hovered over or clicked on
    1. When hovered over it will show you the name of the building/location and give you important information on that site for the day. (Ex. Hover over the CC and it will tell you the menu for lunch if it is lunch time, or hover over the soccer field and it will show you that there is a womens soccer game at 3:30 tomorrow there)
    2. If the building is clicked on it will show you a brief description of the building and a picture of it along with the other information found by hovering.
2. You can map how long it would take you to get to your desired location by walking/biking/driving.

The idea for this app is to create a more connected campus and student body. Some of the advertisements posted on walls get walked by without a second thought, emails from faculty get clicked on and clicked off to remove the notification, but if someone was on this app and saw there was bingo at the WAC in 20 minutes then they would be much more inclined to attend.

Concept3D serves about 675 college campuses in making an interactive 3D map for their websites'. They did a study on their clients and found that the interactive 3D map that they produce gets the most usage/traffic out of any part of the client's websites. It accomplishes almost everything I would want my map to accomplish except for showcasing campus events at the locations on the map. It shows routes, parking, buildings, shops, but since it is a third party it does not put in the events going on at the colleges. It is also a part of the website not an app.

### Hanover Campus map
[Hanover Campus Map PDF](https://leap.hanover.edu/campusmap.php)

This map is a PDF that shows the layout of the campus with a number key for important places. It takes forever to find the number of the building you are looking for in the key and then place it with the cooresponding number on the map. This also has no way of showing your current location on the map so you would have to find a reference point outside of the map. It also has no pictures of the buildings, no descriptions, no campus events shown, and no interactivity whatsoever.

[Hanover Campus Map](https://www.hanover.edu/about/campusmap/)

This map allows you too see the layout of the campus and click on places and get a short description and the name of the location along with a picture. However, it does not allow you to map how far and how long it would take to get places, it also does not use GPS to show where you are at this moment in time, and it does not show events that are upcoming/ongoing at the locations you can click on. It also has a very poor map that shows black and white, no features, no 3D or anything else.
