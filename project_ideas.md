# My Project Ideas

## Idea 1: Hanover ID digitalized
### This would be a card that is inside of your phone that can save students from having to carry around their physical Hanover ID everywhere they go.
### This way students can add it to their apple wallet or openpath and do not have to risk losing their physical ID and paying a fee
