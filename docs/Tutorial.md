# When to use each type of Layers in OpenLayers
OpenLayers makes it easy to put a dynamic map in any web page. It can display map tiles, vector data and markers loaded from any source. 
## Layers:
A layer is a visual representation of data from a source. 
### OpenLayers has four basic types of layers:

**1. TileLayer** - Renders sources that provide tiled images in grids that are organized by zoom levels for specific resolutions.
    
- Essentially the base layer
- I used a tile layer to set up my Open Street Map which is the base of my project.
- My project with the tile layer:

- My project without the tile layer:
