# My Project Ideas

## Idea 1: Golf Media App
 This app would allow golfers to connect with their friends and post their own scores while also allowing them to see your friends scores and what courses they play at. 
 Can recommend other courses and people to play/connect with.
 GPS to show how far away you are from the holes so you do not need to buy a 400$ range finder.
 This would also allow you to keep track of your handicap.

## Idea 2: Hanover ID digitalized
 This would be a card that is inside of your phone that can save students from having to carry around their physical Hanover ID everywhere they go.
 This way students can add it to their apple wallet or openpath and do not have to risk losing their physical ID and paying a fee.
 This would allow students to use mealswipes and get packages and print out papers with just their phone.

## Idea 3: Interactive Hanover GPS 
This would be an app/part of the website that takes you current location on hanover college campus and maps how long it would take you to get to your desired location by walking/biking/driving.
It would also have the buildings and other key locations be able to be hovered over or clicked on and it will show you the name of the building/location and give you important information on that site for the day. (Ex. Hover over the CC and it will tell you the menu for lunch if it is lunch time, or hover over the soccer field and it will show you that there is a womens soccer game at 3:30 tomorrow there)
The idea for this app is to create a more connected campus and student body. Some of the advertisements posted on walls get walked by without a second thought, emails from faculty get clicked on and clicked off to remove the notification, but if someone was on this app and saw there was bingo at the WAC in 20 minutes then they would be much more inclined to attend.
