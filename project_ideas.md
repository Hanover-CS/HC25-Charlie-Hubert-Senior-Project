# My Project Ideas

## Idea 1: Golf Media App
 This app would allow golfers to connect with their friends and post their own scores while also allowing them to see your friends scores and what courses they play at. 
 Can recommend other courses and people to play/connect with.
 GPS to show how far away you are from the holes so you do not need to buy a 400$ range finder.
 This would also allow you to keep track of your handicap.

## Idea 2: Hanover ID digitalized
 This would be a card that is inside of your phone that can save students from having to carry around their physical Hanover ID everywhere they go.
 This way students can add it to their apple wallet or openpath and do not have to risk losing their physical ID and paying a fee.
 This would allow students to use mealswipes and get packages and print out papers with just their phone.
