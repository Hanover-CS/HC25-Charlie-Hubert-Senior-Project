This company serves about 675 college campuses in making an interactive 3D map for their websites'. They did a studdy on their clients and found that the interactive 3D map gets the most usage out of any part of the websites of their clients. It accomplishes almost everything I would want my map to accomplish except for showcasing campus events at the locations on the map. It shows routes, parking, buildings, shops, but since it is a third party it does not put in the events going on at the colleges. It is also a part of the website not an app.
### Hanover Campus map
This map allows you too see the layout of the campus and click on places and get a short description and the name of the location along with a picture. However, it does not allow you to map how far and how long it would take to get places, it does not use GPS to show where you are at this moment in time, and it does not show events that are upcoming/ongoing at the locations you can click on. It also has a very poor map that shows black and white, no features, no 3D or anything else.
