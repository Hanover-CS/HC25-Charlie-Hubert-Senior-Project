# 3D Interactive Map of Hanover College Campus
## Project and Features
This would be an app/part of the Hanover College website that takes your current location on Hanover College Campus and marks it on a 3D map of the campus with the blue dot that you see frequently used on most maps. 
### Features
1. The buildings and other key locations can be hovered over or clicked on
  2. When hovered over it will show you the name of the building/location and give you important information on that site for the day. (Ex. Hover over the CC and it will tell you the menu for lunch if it is lunch time, or hover over the soccer field and it will show you that there is a womens soccer game at 3:30 tomorrow there)
  3. If the building is clicked on it will show you a brief description of the building and a picture of it along with the other information found by hovering.
4. You can map how long it would take you to get to your desired location by walking/biking/driving.

The idea for this app is to create a more connected campus and student body. Some of the advertisements posted on walls get walked by without a second thought, emails from faculty get clicked on and clicked off to remove the notification, but if someone was on this app and saw there was bingo at the WAC in 20 minutes then they would be much more inclined to attend.
